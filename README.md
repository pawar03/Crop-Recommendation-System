# Crop-Recommendation-System


Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Until now, factors such as climate change, population growth and food security concerns have propelled the industry into seeking more innovative approaches to improve crop yield. But the current COVID-19 crisis has further exposed the vulnerability of the agricultural landscape and raised questions about meeting the global food demands sustainably, with adverse factors at play. Again, the answer lies in achieving efficiency- producing more with less, now more than ever.
